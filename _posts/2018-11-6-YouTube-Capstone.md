<h2>Introduction</h2>
What makes people find and click on music on YouTube? Does the way a video is posted have anything to do with how popular it gets? In parts 1-3, I try and partly succeed in predicting how big a music-type video will get. For parts 4-6, I end up pivoting to identifying the most engaging video tags, in an effort to optimize engagement per view for a potential advertiser. In the end, I try to answer the age-old question: What the hell is trap music, actually?
