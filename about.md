I’m an aspiring data scientist who isn’t shy about tackling critical issues. I have always been fascinated by numbers and patterns and use this ability to extract insight and knowledge from hidden details. By using my intuition and skill, I look to see what the data can tell us, and strive to get it to collaborate with the right people to make a positive impact in the world. The truth is in the details, let’s work together.
